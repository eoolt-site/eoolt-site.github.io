<h1>Attending EOOLT 2013</h1>

<h2>Venue and Travel</h2>

<p>
The EOOLT 2013 workshop will take place in Room C60, School of Computer
Science, University of Nottingham:
<blockquote>
    <address>
    School of Computer Science<br>
    Jubilee Campus<br>
    University of Nottingham<Br>
    Wollaton Road<br>
    Nottingham, NG8 1BB<br>
    </address>
</blockquote>
Note that Jubilee Campus is distinct from the main University of Nottingham
campus, University Park. However, the two campuses are within walking distance
of each other (15&ndash;30 minutes, depending) and there is a free shuttle
bus service between them. You can find directions to and from Jubilee
Campus as well as a campus map for downloading (PDF)
<a href="http://www.nottingham.ac.uk/computerscience/about/findingus.aspx">here</a>.
The School of Computer Science is building 4 on the map, and the entrance is
from the lake side. 
</p>

<p>
As per the directions page, there are many and frequent bus connections from
the City Centre to Jubilee Campus. Besides the
<a href="http://www.nctx.co.uk/">Nottingham City Transport</a> (NCT)
lines mentioned, number 36 is also a useful connection, along with the
competing <a href="http://www.catchyourbus.co.uk/">YourBus</a> line Y36.
For the railway station, the <a href="https://www.trentbarton.co.uk/">Trent
Barton</a> Indigo line, which departs from the Broadmarsh Bus Station, could
be more convenient. Single fares from the City Centre are typically 
&pound;1.60&ndash;1.70. NCT wants exact change; TrentBarton and YourBus give
change within reason. A taxi from the City Centre (including railway station)
to Jubilee Campus costs about &pound;6&ndash;8. There are taxi ranks right
outside the railway station as well as in a couple of places in the City
Centre. 
</p>

<p>
Nottingham is located in the centre of England, in East Midlands, and is easy
to reach by train or coach from most population centres in the UK. For
reference, London is about 2 hours away by train. If you're driving, be aware
that traffic can be pretty bad, both on the motorways and in Nottingham
itself; especially during rush-hours, of course. The traffic problems are at
preset compounded by on-going works to extend the Nottingham tram network. 
This does affect the area around the University. While bus services are still
frequent, buses don't always run on schedule. In particular, allow extra time
during rush hours.
</p>

<p>
As to travelling to the UK, train (Eurostar) to London might be an option. The
Eurostar London terminus is St Pancras International, which happens to be
very convenient for Nottingham: most services from London to Nottingham depart
from St Pancras.
</p>

<p>
However, more likely you'll be looking at flying to the UK. Nottingham is
serviced by <a href="http://www.eastmidlandsairport.com/emaweb.nsf">East
Midlands Airport</a> (EMA). If you find a flight into EMA that is convenient
for you, then great: you can find a list of destinations at their web site.
Otherwise, Birmingham International and Manchester Airport are both reasonably
convenient for Nottingham. For example, Nottingham can be reached by train from
Birmingham International in 1.5&ndash;2 hours, and return rail fares are
a reasonable &pound;25 or so. London airports, except Luton which is
on the railway line between London and Nottingham, are less convenient but
certainly possible. For example, Nottingham can typically be reached in about
three hours from Heathrow. However, be aware that any rail connection passing
through London itself is likely to be quite expensive. Cheapest (super
off-peak) return fares London-Nottingham start from about &pound;70.
Stanstead Airport, which is a bit of a hub for low-cost carriers, is also
about 3 hours away by train, but railfares can be a bit cheaper if you avoid
travelling via London (opt for routes through Peterburough or Ely).
</p>

<p>
You may find <a href="http://www.nationalrail.co.uk/">National Rail
Enquiries</a> or <a href="https://www.qjump.co.uk/">Qjump</a>
convenient for checking train options and buying tickets. If you are
willing to commit to specific trains, it is sometimes possible to get
really low fares. Pre-booked tickets can be picked up in ticket
machines at the station of departure. Be aware that you need to use
the payment card used for paying for the tickets to identify yourself,
along with a booking number.
</p>

<h2>Accommodation</h2>

<p>
The following is a list of some hotels that are suitable for the participants
of the EOOLT workshop. The hotels are all a short walk or a short trip by
public transport away from the conference venue. However, there are other

The registration fees for the EOOLT 2013 Workshop are as follows:
<ul>
<li>
Early registration, until Friday 5 April: &pound;95
</li>
<li>
Late registration, from Saturday 6 April: &pound;110

</ul>
Last day of registration:

The registration fee includes the printed proceedings, lunch, and
refreshments. The dinner is extra as some delegates may prefer to leave

</p>

<p>
Registration is via the University of Nottingham Online Store. Just follow
<a href="http://store.nottingham.ac.uk/browse/extra_info.asp?compid=1&catid=4&modid=2&prodid=267&deptid=9&prodvarid=0">this link</a>. Payment by credit card.
If you have not used this store before, you need to go through
a quick registration process first. However, this will likely speed up
the rest of the process as you will have the opportunity to reuse those
details when registering for the workshop as such.
