<h2>Scope</h2>  
During the past decade, integrated model-based design of complex cyber-
physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and networks) has
gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages based on equations,
supporting both continuous-time and event-based aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML,
VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/Simscape) enable high-level reuse and integrated
modeling capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and software
for embedded systems. The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the
art of such equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as well
as open issues that currently still limit their expressiveness, correctness,
and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related
approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain
specific languages, are of particular interest. Specific topics of
interest include (but are not limited to):
<ul>
<li>Acausality and its role in model reusability.</li>
<li>Component systems for EOO languages.</li>
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid modeling.</li>
<li>Embedded systems and efficient code generation.</li>
<li>Modeling language constructs in support of simulation, optimization
    diagnostics, and system identification.</li>
<li>EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML software modeling.</li>
<li>Integrated hardware and software modeling of cyber-physical systems.</li>
<li>Requirement to model traceability, translation, and integration.</li>
<li>Formal semantics of EOO related languages.</li>
<li>Multi-resolution and multi-scale modeling using EOO languages.</li>
<li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages.</li>
<li>Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools.</li>
<li>Parallel execution of EOO models.</li>
<li>Programming and modeling environments.</li> 
<li>Real-time simulation using EOO languages.</li>
<li>Reflection and meta-programming.</li>
<li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking.</li>
<li>Relation to functional reactive programming (FRP) and synchronous
    languages.</li>
<!-- <li>Comparison with related causal or hybrid formalisms.</li> -->
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>  

<p>
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full-length papers (up to
10 pages, EOOLT style, written in English) for consideration by the program
committee. Papers must be original, and not submitted for simultaneous
publication in any other forum. EOOLT welcomes original research contributions
as well as contributions with a focus on practice, such as experience reports
and comparisons of existing languages and tools. Each contributions will be
judged according to criteria appropriate for its kind.
</p>

<p>
Templates and author guidelines are available both for the <a
href="eoolt-2013-latex-template-v2.zip">LaTeX</a> and the <a
href="eoolt-2013-word-template-v2.zip">Microsoft Word/LibreOffice</a>
environment.
</p>

<p>
Papers should be submitted as PDF-files in A4 format, using the 
<!--
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/">Easy Chair</a>
conference management system. Exact details TBA. See above for key dates.
-->
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2013">Easy
Chair</a> conference management system.
</p>

<h2>Publication</h2>

<p>
Accepted papers will be published electronically by Link&ouml;ping University
Electronic Press. Each author/coauthor needs to sign and fax an agreement to
allow Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press to publish your paper. All
authors retain copyright of their work. Authors of accepted papers should
present their paper at the workshop. See <a href="#camera">below</a> for
details on submitting the camera ready version. <!-- Further details TBA. -->
</p>

<h2>Other Contributions</h2>

<p>
To allow for a more dynamic workshop format, the EOOLT PC will, subject to
space in the program, consider proposals for other kinds of program points,
such as tool demonstrations or discussion sessions on some timely topics in
the scope of EOOLT. Such proposals will be judged by the PC as a whole on the
grounds of how much interest they add to the workshop, and they should thus
not be confused with formally peer-reviewed contributions. That said, if
considered appropriate and useful, the PC may invite a short (1&ndash;2 pages)
written outline for inclusion in the workshop proceedings (clearly labelled
to distinguish it from regular papers).
</p>

<p>
Simply send a brief e-mail to the conference Chair outlining your idea,
by the same deadline as for the abstract submission (see above).
</p>

<a name=camera></a>
<h2>Camera-Ready Version</h2>

<p>
The camera-ready version of papers and abstracts should be uploaded using the
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2013">Easy Chair</a>
conference management system. The deadline is
<blockquote>
<b><font color="#ff0000">22 March</font></b>
</blockquote>
This is a strict deadline as the publication timeline is very tight.
</p>

<p>
Please ensure your camera ready version adheres strictly to the EOOLT
formatting guidelines, and please also take the following points into
account:
<ul>
<li>
    Please update the copyright notice in your paper to include the
    correct URL to the on-line version of the proceedings:
    <blockquote>
         <tt>http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_home/index.en.aspx?issue=084</tt>
    </blockquote>
    If you are using the EOOLT LaTeX template to prepare your paper,
    simply download and use the latest version (ver. 2) 
    <a href="eoolt-2013-latex-template-v2.zip ">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
    If you are making a contribution such as a tool demonstration and
    you have been invited to submit a short abstract for the proceedings,
    please be sure that that the title of the abstract explicitly makes it
    clear it is such an abstract. For a tool demonstration abstract, the title
    should start with &ldquo;Tool Demonstration Abstract:&rdquo;. For other
    kinds of abstract, adapt the title accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Each author/coauthor needs to sign and fax an agreement to allow
Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press to publish your paper or
abstract. All authors retain copyright of their work. 
</p>

<p>
Print, sign, and fax
<a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/084/EOOLT_2013.pdf">this PDF file</a> to
+46 13 28 4424, attention Peter Berkesand no later than 22 March 2013.
Alternatively, scan the signed agreement, save the result as a PDF, and 
e-mail it to
<a href="mailto:peter.berkesand@liu.se">peter.berkesand@liu.se</a>.
Should you need to contact Peter Berkesand, e-mail him or call him at 
+46 13 28 29 45.
