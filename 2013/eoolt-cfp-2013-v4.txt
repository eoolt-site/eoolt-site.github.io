			       CALL FOR PAPERS


During the past decade, integrated model-based design of complex cyber-
physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and networks) has
gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages based on equations,
supporting both continuous-time and event-based aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML,
VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/Simscape) enable high-level reuse and integrated
modeling capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and software
for embedded systems. The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the
art of such equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as well
as open issues that currently still limit their expressiveness, correctness,
and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related
approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain
specific languages, are of particular interest. Specific topics of
interest include (but are not limited to):

  o Acausality and its role in model reusability. 
  o Component systems for EOO languages. 
  o Discrete-event and hybrid modeling.
  o Embedded systems and efficient code generation. 
  o Modeling language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, 
    diagnostics, and system identification. 
  o EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML software modeling. 
  o Integrated hardware and software modeling of cyber-physical systems.
  o Requirement to model traceability, translation, and integration.
  o Formal semantics of EOO related languages. 
  o Multi-resolution and multi-scale modeling using EOO languages. 
  o Model-driven development related to EOO languages.
  o Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools. 
  o Parallel execution of EOO models. 
  o Programming and modeling environments. 
  o Real-time simulation using EOO languages. 
  o Reflection and meta-programming. 
  o Verification, type systems, and early static checking. 
  o Relation to functional reactive programming (FRP) and 
    synchronous languages.


SUBMISSION

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full-length papers (up to
10 pages, EOOLT style, written in English) for consideration by the program
committee. Papers must be original, and not submitted for simultaneous
publication in any other forum. EOOLT welcomes original research contributions
as well as contributions with a focus on practice, such as experience reports
and comparisons of existing languages and tools. Each contributions will be
judged according to criteria appropriate for its kind. For submission details,
see the EOOLT 2013 website (link below).


OTHER CONTRIBUTIONS

To allow for a more dynamic workshop format, the EOOLT PC will, subject to
space in the program, consider proposals for other kinds of program points,
such as tool demonstrations or discussion sessions on some timely topics in
the scope of EOOLT. Such proposals will be judged by the PC as a whole on the
grounds of how much interest they add to the workshop, and they should thus
not be confused with formally peer-reviewed contributions. That said, if
considered appropriate and useful, the PC may invite a short (1 - 2 pages)
written outline for inclusion in the workshop proceedings (clearly labeled
to distinguish it from regular papers). For further details, see the EOOLT
2013 website (link below).

Electronic Press. Authors of accepted papers should present their paper
at the workshop.
