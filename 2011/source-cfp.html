<h2>Scope</h2>  
During the past decade, integrated model-based design of complex cyber-physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and networks) has gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages based on equations, supporting both continuous-time and event-based aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/ Simscape) enable high-level reuse and integrated modeling capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and software for embedded systems. The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of such equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as well as open issues that currently still limit their expressiveness, correctness, and use-fulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain specific languages, are of particular interest. 

The workshop is concerned with, but not limited to, the following EOO related themes:

<ul>
<li>Acausality and its role in model reusability. 
<li>Component systems for EOO languages. 
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid modeling.
<li>Embedded systems and efficient code generation. 
<li>Modeling language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, diagnostics, and system identification. 
<li>EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML software modeling. 
<li>Integrated hardware / software modeling of cyber-physical systems.
<li>Requirement to model traceability, translation, and integration.
<li>Formal semantics of EOO related languages. 
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages. 
<li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages.
<li>Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools. 
<li>Parallel execution of EOO models. 
<li>Programming / modeling environments. 
<li>Real-time simulation using EOO languages. 
<li>Reflection and meta-programming. 
<li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking. 
<li>Relation to functional reactive programming (FRP) and synchronous languages.
<li>Comparison with related causal or hybrid formalisms.
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>  
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full-length papers (up to 10 pages) for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics. 


<p>
Templates and author guidelines are available both for the <a href="eoolt-2011-latex-template.zip">LaTeX</a> and the <a href="eoolt-2011-word-template.zip">Microsoft Word</a> environment.

Papers should be submitted as PDF-files in A4 format, using the <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2011">online submission system</a>.



<h2>Publication</h2>
If a paper has been accepted, the authors should present the paper at the workshop and also have the paper published in electronic proceedings (and a local conference paper version) at Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press.
