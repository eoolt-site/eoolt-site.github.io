<h1>Call for Papers</h1>

<h2>Important Dates</h2>
<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: <b><font color=red>June 17 (extended)</font></b>
<li>Author notification: <b>July 1</b>
<li>Camera-ready: <b>September 10</b>
<li>Workshop: <b>October 3</b>
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>  
During the last decade, integrated model-based design of complex cyber-physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and networks) has gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages based on equations, supporting both continuous-time and event-based aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/Simscape) enable high level reuse and integrated modeling capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and software for embedded systems. The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of such equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as well as open issues that currently still limit their expressiveness, correctness, and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches and languages, such as actor oriented, synchronous, and domain specific languages, are of particular interest. The workshop is concerned with, but not limited to, the following EOO related themes:

<p>


<ul>
<li>Acausality and its role in model reusability. 
<li>Component systems for EOO languages. 
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid modeling.
<li>Embedded systems and efficient code generation. 
<li>Modeling language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, 
diagnostics, and system identification. 
<li>EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML software modeling. 
<li>Integrated hardware-software modeling of cyberphysical systems.
<li>Requirement to model traceability, translation, and integration.
<li>Formal semantics of EOO related languages. 
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages. 
<li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages.
<li>Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools. 
<li>Parallel execution of EOO models. 
<li>Programming / modeling environments. 
<li>Real-time simulation using EOO languages. 
<li>Reflection and meta-programming. 
<li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking. 
<li>Relation to functional reactive programming (FRP) and 
synchronous languages.
<li>Comparison with related causal or hybrid formalisms.
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2>  
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full-length papers (up to 10 pages) for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics. 


<p>
Templates and author guidelines are available both for the <a href="eoolt-2010-latex-template.zip">LaTeX</a> and the <a href="eoolt-2010-word-template.zip">Microsoft Word</a> environment. Papers should be submitted as PDF-files in A4 format, using the <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2010">online submission system</a>.



<h2>Publication</h2>
If a paper has been accepted, the authors should present the paper at the workshop and also have the paper published in electronic proceedings (and a local conference paper version) at Linköping University Electronic Press.
