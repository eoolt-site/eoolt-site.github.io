Many engineers rely heavily on model-based design and control of complex
cyber-physical systems. Of paramount importance is the ability to capture all
central aspects of such systems in the models, including the physical behavior
of the system components and the architecture description of its software and
hardware. This calls for a special class of modelling languages: hybrid
modeling languages based on equations that support both continuous-time and
event-based aspects. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS and Simulink/Simscape are
prominent examples. Using such a language offers a number of advantages:
models can be reused, integration can be tested in an early design phase, and
simulation code can be generated for a number of different platforms.

The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of
equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages and explores topics
that aim to overcome limits of their expressiveness, correctness, and
usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches
and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain specific
languages, are of particular interest.
</p>
<p>
Contributions to this workshop focus on methodological aspects and describe
new solutions for the design and use of equation-based languages. In addition
to full contributions, shorter work-in-progress paper are welcome,
offering an opportunity to discuss current approaches within the community.

<p>

aspects to simulation code:

<ul>
<li>Design aspects of equation-based languages and their formal semantics
<li>Relation to other languages such as functional reactive programming (FRP) or synchronous languages
<li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid system modeling
<li>Acausality/non-causality and its role in model reusability
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages
<li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages
<li>Equation-based modeling in the frame of system engineering
<li>Reflection and meta-programming
<li>Environments for modeling, simulation and debugging
<li>Mathematical formalisms for simulation semantics
<li>Code generation for real-time systems, embedded system, multi-core platforms, and distributed systems
<li>Tools for analyzing or optimizing equation-based models
</ul>
