<h2>Scope</h2>  
<p>
Contributions to this workshop focus on methodological aspects and describe
new solutions for the design and use of equation-based languages. In addition
to full contributions, shorter work-in-progress papers are welcome,
offering an opportunity to discuss current approaches within the community.
</p>
<p>
Typical themes of the EOOLT workshop range from language design via modeling
aspects to simulation code:

<ul>
<li>Design aspects of equation-based languages and their formal semantics
<li>Relation to other languages such as functional reactive programming (FRP) or synchronous languages
<li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid system modeling
<li>Acausality/non-causality and its role in model reusability
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages
<li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages
<li>Equation-based modeling in the frame of system engineering
<li>Reflection and meta-programming
<li>Environments for modeling, simulation and debugging
<li>Mathematical formalisms for simulation semantics
<li>Code generation for real-time systems, embedded system, multi-core platforms, and distributed systems
<li>Algorithms and tools for analyzing or optimizing equation-based models
</ul>
</p>


<h2>Submission</h2> 
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit the following contributions: 
<ol>
<li> Full length research papers: up to 10 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, benchmarks, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics. 
<li> Work-in-progress papers: up to 4 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of work-in-progress and open problem statements that can be thoroughly discussed during the workshop.   
</ol>

<p>
All submissions must describe original research work, not previously 
published or submitted for publication elsewhere. The program 
committee will evaluate the papers' technical contributions, relevance, 
originality, correctness, and clarity.
</p>

More information about submission and publication will be provided soon.

<!--
<p> 
Papers should be submitted as PDF-files, following the <a
href="http://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template">Templates</a> (Please use ACM SigConf template). All papers should be submitted using the <a
href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2017">EasyChair conference management system</a>. In case technical problems with the templates should occur you can address ACMâ€™s TeX support team at Aptara (<a href="mailto:acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com">acmtexsupport@aptaracorp.com</a> ) for help.
</p>

<p>
The Programme Chair is exclusively responsible for coordinating the paper selection process and may thus not submit any papers to EOOLT. Submissions (co-)authored by PC members are encouraged, but are subject to extra careful consideration as per the <a href="http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/">ACM SIGPLAN policy</a>. It is EOOLT policy to allow the General Chair to submit papers as he or she is just an ordinary member of the Programme Committee when it comes to the paper selection.
</p>





<h2>Publication</h2> If a paper has been accepted, the authors should present the paper at the workshop. 

All accepted papers will be published in the Scopus-indexed <a href="http://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a>
within the ACM international conference proceedings series (ICPS). For final publication, PDFs and source files will be required.<br>

Copyright will be transferred to ACM digital library but the author still holds vital rights such as to:
<ul>
    <li>Post the Accepted Version of the Work on the Author's home page</li>
    <li>Create a "Major Revision" which is not subject to any rights in the original that have been granted to ACM</li>
    <li>Reuse of any portion of the Work, without fee, in any future works written or edited by the Author, including books, lectures and presentations in any and all media</li>
</ul>

The exact regulations can be found on <a href="http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy">www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright_policy</a>. Work-in-progress papers are published in the proceeding just like normal papers are. They are simply marked as such and being limited in size to 4 pages.

<h2>Other Contributions</h2>

<p>
To allow for a more dynamic workshop format, the EOOLT PC will, subject to
space in the program, consider proposals for other kinds of program points,
such as tool demonstrations or discussion sessions on some timely topics in
the scope of EOOLT. Such proposals will be judged by the PC as a whole on the
grounds of how much interest they add to the workshop, and they should thus
not be confused with formally peer-reviewed contributions. That said, if
considered appropriate and useful, the PC may invite a short (1&ndash;2 pages)
written outline for distribution at the workshop (clearly labelled
to distinguish it from regular papers).
</p>

<p>
Simply send a brief e-mail to the conference Chair outlining your idea,
by the same deadline as for the abstract submission (see above).
</p>

environment.
</p>


<h2>Publication</h2>

<p>
Accepted papers will be published electronically by Link&ouml;ping University
Electronic Press. Each author/coauthor needs to sign and fax an agreement to
allow Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press to publish your paper. All
authors retain copyright of their work. Authors of accepted papers should
present their paper at the workshop. See <a href="#camera">below</a> for
details on submitting the camera ready version.

<h2>Camera-Ready Version</h2>

<p>
The camera-ready version of papers and abstracts should be uploaded using the

<blockquote>
<b><font color="#ff0000">22 March</font></b>

</li>
<li>
    If you are making a contribution such as a tool demonstration and
    you have been invited to submit a short abstract for the proceedings,
    please be sure that that the title of the abstract explicitly makes it
    clear it is such an abstract. For a tool demonstration abstract, the title
    should start with &ldquo;Tool Demonstration Abstract:&rdquo;. For other
    kinds of abstract, adapt the title accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
