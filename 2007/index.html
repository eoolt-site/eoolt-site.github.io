<h2>EOOLT - Berlin July 30, 2007</h2>

<a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp/contents.asp?issue=024">EOOLT 2007 Proceedings (Open Access)</a><p>

Computer aided modeling and simulation of complex systems, using components from multiple application domains, such as electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, control, etc., have in recent years witnessed a significant growth of interest. In the last decade, novel equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, (e.g. Modelica, gPROMS, and VHDL-AMS) based on acausal modeling using equations have appeared. Using such languages, it has become possible to model complex systems covering multiple application domains at a high level of abstraction through reusable model components. 
<p>
The EOOLT Workshop addresses the current state of the art of EOO modeling languages as well as open issues that currently still limit the expression power and usefulness of such languages through a set of full-length presentations, short position papers, and forum discussions.
<p>
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit either full-length research papers (up to 10 pages) or short position papers (up to 4 pages) for consideration by the program committee.


<h2>Motivation</h2>
The interest in EOO languages and tools is rapidly growing in the industry because of their increasing importance in modeling, simulation, and specification of complex systems. There exist several different EOO language communities today that grew out of different application areas (multi-body system dynamics, electronic circuit simulation, chemical process engineering).  The members of these disparate communities rarely talk to each other in spite of the similarities of their modeling and simulation needs.
<p>
The EOOLT Workshop aims at bringing these different communities together to discuss their common needs and goals as well as the algorithms and tools that best support them.
