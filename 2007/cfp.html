<h2>Call for Papers</h2>
Computer aided modeling and simulation of complex systems, using components from multiple application domains, such as electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, control, etc., have in recent years witnessed a significant growth of interest. In the last decade, novel equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, (e.g. Modelica, gPROMS, and VHDL-AMS) based on acausal modeling using equations have appeared. Using such languages, it has become possible to model complex systems covering multiple application domains at a high level of abstraction through reusable model components.
<p>
The EOOLT Workshop addresses the current state of the art of EOO modeling languages as well as open issues that currently still limit the expression power and usefulness of such languages through a set of full-length presentations, short position papers, and forum discussions.
<p>
The workshop is concerned with, but not limited to, the following themes: 




<ul>
<li>Acausality and its role in model reusability.
<li>Component systems for EOO languages. 
<li>Database lookup and knowledge invocation.
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid modeling using EOO languages. 
<li>Embedded systems.
<li>EOO language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, diagnostics, and system identification. 
<li>EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML modeling. 
<li>Equation-based languages supporting DAEs and/or PDEs.
<li>Formal semantics of EOO related languages.
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages.
<li>Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools.
<li>Parallel execution of EOO models. 
<li>Performance issues. 
<li>Programming / modeling environments.
<li>Real-time simulation using EOO languages.
<li>Reflection and meta-programming. 
<li>Reuse of models in EOO languages. 
<li>Table lookup and interpolation.
<li>Type systems and early static checking. 
<li>Verification. 
</ul>


Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit either full-length papers (up to 10 pages) or short papers (up to 4 pages) for consideration by the program committee. 
<p>
Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics. 

<h2>Publication</h2>

If a paper has been accepted, the authors have two options:

<ul>
<li>Present the paper and also have the paper published in electronic proceedings (and a local conference paper version) at <a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/">Linköping University Electronic Press</a>. The best of these papers will be selected and the authors will be asked to resubmit an extended version for review and to be possibly published in the <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622330/description"> SIMPRA journal</a>.

<li>Present the paper, but do not publish it - and thus be free to publish elsewhere e.g. in another conference. Only a short 1-page abstract is included in the proceedings.
</ul>
