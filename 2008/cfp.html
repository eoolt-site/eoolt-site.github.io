<h2>Scope</h2>  


Computer aided modeling and simulation of complex systems, using components from multiple application domains, such as electrical, mechanical, hydraulic, control, etc., have in recent years witnessed a significant growth of interest. In the last decade, novel modeling and simulation languages, (e.g. Modelica, gPROMS, Chi, Verilog-AMS, and VHDL-AMS) based on acausal modeling using differential algebraic equations (DAEs) have appeared. Using such languages, it has become possible to model complex systems covering multiple application domains at a high level of abstraction through reusable model components. In the last couple of years the name equation-based object-oriented (EOO) language has been introduced to denote modeling languages within this category.
<p>
The EOOLT Workshop addresses the current state of the art of EOO modeling languages as well as open issues that currently still limit the expression power, correctness, and usefulness of such languages through a set of full-length presentations and forum discussions.  
<p>
The workshop is concerned with, but not limited to, the following themes: 


<ul>
<li>Acausality and its role in model reusability.
<li>Component systems for EOO languages. 
<li>Database lookup and knowledge invocation.
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid modeling using EOO languages. 
<li>Embedded systems.
<li>EOO language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, diagnostics, and system identification. 
<li>EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML modeling. 
<li>Equation-based languages supporting DAEs and/or PDEs.
<li>Formal semantics of EOO related languages.
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages.
<li>Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools.
<li>Parallel execution of EOO models. 
<li>Performance issues. 
<li>Programming / modeling environments.
<li>Real-time simulation using EOO languages.
<li>Reflection and meta-programming. 
<li>Reuse of models in EOO languages. 
<li>Table lookup and interpolation.
<li>Type systems and early static checking. 
<li>Verification. 
<li>Model-driven development.
</ul>


<a name=submission></a>
<h2>Submission</h2>  

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit full-length papers (up to 10 pages) for consideration by the program committee. Templates and author guidelines are available both for the <a href="eoolt-2008-latex-template.zip">LaTeX</a> and the <a href="eoolt-2008-word-template.zip">Microsoft Word</a> environment. Papers should be submitted as PDF-files in A4 format, using the <a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2008">online submission system</a>.
<p>

<p>
Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics. The aim is also to augment the computer science perspective within this community, making contributes from this area particular welcome.

<h2>Publication</h2>

If a paper has been accepted, the authors should present the paper at the workshop and also have the paper published in electronic proceedings (and a local conference paper version) at <a href="http://www.ep.liu.se/">Linköping University Electronic Press</a>. The best of these papers will be selected and the authors will be asked to resubmit an extended version for review and to be possibly published in the <a href="http://www.elsevier.com/wps/find/journaldescription.cws_home/622330/description"> SIMPRA journal</a>.
