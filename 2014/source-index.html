During the past decade, integrated model-based design of complex
cyber-physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and
networks) has gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages based on
equations, supporting both continuous-time and event-based aspects (e.g. 
Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/ Simscape) enable high-level reuse and
integrated modeling capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and
software for embedded systems. The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state
of the art of such equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as
well as open issues that currently still limit their expressiveness,
correctness, and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with
related approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and
domain specific languages, are of particular interest.
