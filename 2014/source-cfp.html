<h2>Important dates</h2> 

<ul>
<li>Submission deadline: <b><font color=red>July 6 (extended)</font></b>

<li>Camera-ready: September 7
<li>Workshop: October 10
</ul>

<h2>Scope</h2>  
During the past decade, integrated model-based design of complex cyber-physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and networks) has gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages based on equations, supporting both continuous-time and event- based aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/Simscape) enable high-level reuse and integrated capabilities of both the physically surrounding system and the software for embedded systems. The EOOLT workshop addresses the current state of the art of equation-based object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as well as open issues that currently still limit their expressiveness, correctness, and usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and domain-specific languages, are of particular interest. 

The workshop is concerned with, but not limited to, the following EOO related themes
<ul>
<li>Acausality and its role in model reusability. 
<li>Component systems for EOO languages. 
<li>Discrete-event and hybrid modeling.
<li>Embedded systems and efficient-code generation. 
<li>Modeling language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, diagnostics, and system identification. 
<li>EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML software model-ing. 
<li>Integrated hardware-software modeling of cyber-physical systems.
<li>Requirements for modeling traceability, translation, and integration.
<li>Formal semantics of EOO related languages. 
<li>Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO lan-guages. 
<li>Model-driven development related to EOO languages.
<li>Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simula-tion tools. 
<li>Parallel execution of EOO models. 
<li>Programming / modeling environments. 
<li>Real-time simulation using EOO languages. 
<li>Reflection and meta-programming. 
<li>Verification, type systems, and early static checking. 
<li>Relation to functional reactive programming (FRP) and synchronous languages.
<li>Comparison with related causal or hybrid formalisms.
<li>Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)
</ul>

<h2>Submission</h2> 
Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit the following contributions: 
<ol>
<li> Full length research papers: up to 10 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of languages, tools, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant questions; and discussion topics. 
<li> 2.	Work-in-progress papers: up to 4 pages for consideration by the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and discussions of work-in-progress and problem statements that can be thoroughly discussed during the workshop.   
</ol>

<p>
All submissions must describe original research work, not previously 
published or submitted for publication elsewhere. The program 
committee will evaluate the papers' technical contributions, relevance, 
originality, correctness, and clarity.

<p> 
Papers should be submitted as PDF-files, following the <a
href="http://www.acm.org/sigs/publications/proceedings-templates">ACM
SIG Proceedings Templates</a> (LaTeX users may use option 2). All
papers should be submitted using the <a
href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2014">EasyChair conference management system</a> before <a
href="http://www.timeanddate.com/countdown/generic?p0=224&iso=20140706T235959&year=2014&month=7&day=6&hour=23&min=59&sec=59&msg=EOOLT%202014%20Submission%20%28extended%29">
the end of July 6, pacific standard time (PST)</a>.  
</p>


<h2>Publication</h2> If a paper has been accepted, the authors should
present the paper at the workshop. All accepted papers will be
published in the <a href="http://dl.acm.org/">ACM Digital Library</a>
within the ACM international conference proceedings series (ICPS).

<p>
Templates and author guidelines are available both for the <a

</p>


<h2>Publication</h2>

<p>
Accepted papers will be published electronically by Link&ouml;ping University
Electronic Press. Each author/coauthor needs to sign and fax an agreement to
allow Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press to publish your paper. All
authors retain copyright of their work. Authors of accepted papers should
present their paper at the workshop. See <a href="#camera">below</a> for
details on submitting the camera ready version.

<h2>Camera-Ready Version</h2>

<p>
The camera-ready version of papers and abstracts should be uploaded using the
<a href="http://www.easychair.org/conferences/?conf=eoolt2013">Easy Chair</a>
conference management system. The deadline is
<blockquote>
<b><font color="#ff0000">22 March</font></b>
</blockquote>
This is a strict deadline as the publication timeline is very tight.
</p>

<p>
Please ensure your camera ready version adheres strictly to the EOOLT
formatting guidelines, and please also take the following points into
account:
<ul>
<li>
    Please update the copyright notice in your paper to include the
    correct URL to the on-line version of the proceedings:
    <blockquote>
         <tt>http://www.ep.liu.se/ecp_home/index.en.aspx?issue=084</tt>
    </blockquote>
    If you are using the EOOLT LaTeX template to prepare your paper,
    simply download and use the latest version (ver. 2) 
    <a href="eoolt-2013-latex-template-v2.zip ">here</a>.
</li>
<li>
    If you are making a contribution such as a tool demonstration and
    you have been invited to submit a short abstract for the proceedings,
    please be sure that that the title of the abstract explicitly makes it
    clear it is such an abstract. For a tool demonstration abstract, the title
    should start with &ldquo;Tool Demonstration Abstract:&rdquo;. For other
    kinds of abstract, adapt the title accordingly.
</li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Each author/coauthor needs to sign and fax an agreement to allow
Link&ouml;ping University Electronic Press to publish your paper or
abstract. All authors retain copyright of their work.
