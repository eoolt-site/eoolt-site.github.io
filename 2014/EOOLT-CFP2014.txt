SCOPE

During the past decade, integrated model-based design of complex
cyber-physical systems (which mix physical dynamics with software and
networks) has gained significant attention. Hybrid modeling languages
based on equations, supporting both continuous-time and event- based
aspects (e.g. Modelica, SysML, VHDL-AMS, and Simulink/Simscape) enable
high-level reuse and integrated capabilities of both the physically
surrounding system and the software for embedded systems. The EOOLT
workshop addresses the current state of the art of equation-based
object-oriented (EOO) modeling languages, as well as open issues that
currently still limit their expressiveness, correctness, and
usefulness. Moreover, integration of and comparison with related
approaches and languages, such as actor-oriented, synchronous, and
domain-specific languages, are of particular interest. The workshop is
concerned with, but not limited to, the following EOO related themes

* Acausality and its role in model reusability. 
* Component systems for EOO languages. 
* Discrete-event and hybrid modeling.
* Embedded systems and efficient-code generation. 
* Modeling language constructs in support of simulation, optimization, 
  diagnostics, and system identification. 
* EOO mathematical modeling vs. UML software modeling. 
* Integrated hardware-software modeling of cyber-physical systems.
* Requirements for modeling traceability, translation, and integration.
* Formal semantics of EOO related languages. 
* Multi-resolution / multi-scale modeling using EOO languages. 
* Model-driven development related to EOO languages.
* Numerical coupling of EOO simulators and other simulation tools. 
* Parallel execution of EOO models. 
* Programming / modeling environments. 
* Real-time simulation using EOO languages. 
* Reflection and meta-programming. 
* Verification, type systems, and early static checking. 
* Relation to functional reactive programming (FRP) and synchronous 
  languages.
* Comparison with related causal or hybrid formalisms.
* Functional Mock-up Interface (FMI)



SUBMISSION

Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit the following
contributions:

1. Full length research papers: up to 10 pages for consideration by
the program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and
discussions of existing languages and tools, their capabilities and
limitations; reports on practical experience; demonstrations of
languages, tools, ideas, and concepts; positions related to relevant
questions; and discussion topics.  

2. Work-in-progress papers: up to 4 pages for consideration by the
program committee. Papers are welcome that offer presentations and
discussions of work-in-progress and problem statements that can be
thoroughly discussed during the workshop.

All submissions must describe original research work, not previously 
published or submitted for publication elsewhere. The program 
committee will evaluate the papers' technical contributions, relevance, 
originality, correctness, and clarity.

IMPORTANT DATES

* Submission deadline: July 6 (extended)
* Author notification: August 10
* Camera-ready: September 7
* Workshop: October 10


PUBLICATION

If a paper has been accepted, the authors should present the 
paper at the workshop. All accepted papers will be published 
in the ACM digital library within the ACM international 
conference proceedings series (ICPS).
